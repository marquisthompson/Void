# Void
"Void" is the result of an idea I had a little while ago for merging A.I. with database manipulation.

Currently all instruction on how to use this application is on youtube. Simply go to youtube.com and search "Marquis Thompson"
to watch my videos explaining the different features available.




!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ATTENTION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
when you download this application, it WILL NOT work until
you setup the database folder. Luckily this is an EXTREMELY
simple process.

STEP  #1: figure out where you want to put your copy of void

STEP  #2: put void in that location you chose in step #1

STEP  #3: go to that location in "File Explorer" app

STEP  #4: right click to open contex menu

STEP  #5: hover mouse pointer over "new"

STEP  #6: click File

STEP  #7: rename your new folder to "DATABASE"

STEP  #8: make sure you spelled the name in all caps with no other characters 
         THIS STEP IS VERY IMPORTANT;
         THE APPLICATION WILL NOT WORK IF YOU DO NOT FOLLOW THIS STEP PROPERLY

STEP  #9: open the "DATABASE" folder in a new window (this folder should be empty)

STEP #10: go to the previous file explorer window and run the "Void" application

STEP #11: make sure 11 new files were created in your "DATABASE" folder
          IF THIS IS DOES NOT HAPPEN, SOMETHING IS WRONG;
          DELETE THE APPLICATION, RE-DOWNLOAD IT, and go back to step #10

The first time you setup your datanet, the "Void" application might immediately close the first few times you run it.
This is not automatically a problem. Just keep runnung the application until it stays open (sometimes it takes a few attempts for the app to completely synchronize with the database folder). However, if the application does not sync with database folder within 10 attempts to run it, then something is wring and the application needs to be reinstalled.
